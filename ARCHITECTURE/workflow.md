## Ride-hailing Service Workflow with Combined Steps

Here's a breakdown of the ride-hailing service workflow with the driver matching and assignment steps combined:

1. The user initiates a ride request through the mobile application, creating a "ride_requested" event.

2. The User Application publishes the "ride_requested" event.

3. The Driver Matching Service listens for "ride_requested" events. It identifies a suitable driver based on location and availability, then directly assigns them to the ride request.

4. The system publishes a "driver_assigned" event to the messaging system.

5. The Notification Service receives the "driver_assigned" event and sends a message to the user's phone about the assigned driver.

6. Depending on the workflow, the driver might receive the notification and choose to accept or decline the ride. If they accept, they might send an "accepted_ride" event back.

7. The Ride Confirmation Service receives either the "accepted_ride" event (if driver acceptance is required) or directly the "ride_requested" event (for auto-assigned rides). It then confirms the ride for both the user and driver.

8.The Ride Confirmation Service publishes a "ride_confirmed" event, notifying the user about the assigned driver and estimated arrival time.

9.  The Location Tracking Service starts monitoring the driver's location updates received from the Driver Application. This allows for navigation and progress updates for the user.

10.  The Driver Application continues to send location updates periodically to the Location Tracking Service.

11.  Once the ride is finished, the Driver Application sends a "ride_completed" event to the messaging system.

12. The Payment Processing Service receives the "ride_completed" event and initiates the payment process based on the predetermined fare structure.

13. The Payment Processing Service handles payment internally, charging the rider and compensating the driver.

14. The user might be prompted by the Feedback Service (separate system or within the user app) to provide feedback about the ride experience.

15.If the user chooses to provide feedback, the Feedback Service collects it for future improvements within the ride-hailing system.
